            <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce or sriracha</li>
            <li>¼ cup honey or brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds to garnish</li>
            <li>chopped green onion to garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the chicken to the Instant Pot, followed by soy sauce, garlic, ginger, ketchup, and hot sauce or sriracha. Give everything a quick stir.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with the lid, and make sure that the valve is in sealing position. Press on MANUAL or PRESSURE COOK (this depends on which Instant Pot do you have), and cook on high for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow the Instant Pot to come to pressure, and count down to when it beeps, quickly release the steam by turning the vent to RELEASE position and make sure that it's not close to your face as the steam will be really hot.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the lid, and press on the SAUTE setting. Add the honey (or brown sugar), sesame oil, and make the cornstarch slurry.</li>
            <li>To make the slurry, combine 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water. Add it to the sauce, and stir with a wooden spoon until the sauce thickens. Switch off the saute setting.</li>
            <li>Serve over rice, and garnish with chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
